# SENTIMENT-CLASSFICATION-ON-PRODCUT-REVIEWS
The aim of this challenge is to develop a sentiment classifier that can assign a large set of product reviews to the five levels of polarity of opinion as accurately as possible, given a small amount of labeled reviews and a large amount of unlabelled reviews. It is a multi-class classification task, where each product review is labeled with one of the five sentiment labels, which are strong negative, weak negative, neutral, weak positive, and strong positive

***Sentiment Classifier has been developed by implementing one of 3 algorithms i.e*** <br> 
   ***1. Logistic Regression*** <br> 
   ***2. Naive Bayes*** <br> 
   ***3. Deep Learning using Neural Networks***

***The goal of the task is classify unlabelled product reviews  (data of 600k records with unlabelled classification)
by training the model with the labeled data (data of 50k records with labelled classification) and testing data <br> (data of 50k records)***

### Complete data cleaning, model training, model selection and computing model accuracy is described in the Project_Report file.
